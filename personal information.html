 <h2> Personal Introduction </h2>
  <p> This page is about myself. </p>
  <p> My name is JUNHUA ODNG, I was born in CHINA and lived there for exactly 18 years. Different countries have different enviorrment and so is
  with United States and CHina. I complete two years in City college of Chicago and now I am transfer student in IIT as the ITM major. This is 
  currently my 2nd semester after spring, and it keeps getting interesting as it goes.</p>

  <p> I like to live a very simple life along with working hard for my goals and getting it through achievemets. My favourite class is Java in IIT Focus and hard work always pay off at the right time, which I have experienced. </p>
	<p>  I like to play basketball, which is same as I love to watch sport's live shows and also love listening to chinese songs and few hollywood songs. Travelling to different places across the world is my dream.</p>
